# Play
> What to do, wherever you may roam

## Philosophy
`Play` strives to be the place you go when it comes to discovering what is there to do for you today, tonight, in your hometown, or wherever you may roam.

It's also based around simplicity. 3 things count: where are you, what are you interested in, and whether you are going or not. Nothing more.

There's no user profiles, or photo albums, no in-app messaging, no following.

### 1. Where are you
As you login to the app, you automatically get geolocated –failing that the app will guess your location based on your ISP and show you a map with both the guess and the ability to correct it.

What is happening here is that we are taking your position and crunching our data to see what is really close to you. Whether you like that stuff or not, we will learn over time.

### 2. What are you interested in
At the beginning we will have no real clue about the user. Facebook interests are ok at first, but people are known for liking stuff they don't really like (specially when it's for friends, prizes, or they are tricked into it), so we will use that information as a base.

Being interested in something is not really a matter of clicking a like button. We believe that being interested in something is really more about going to the events, checking-in at the venues. That stuff really proves you are interested in something, and it adds up.

It's not a Boolean value, but rather incremental. If I went to 10 out of 11 Rush's concerts in the past year, why on earth would anyone say someone who hasn't attended any of them but clicked a "Like" button likes Rush just as much as I do?

As your interests grow, we will be able to properly suggest other events and venues, and filter the stuff you're less likely to be interested in.

Interests are represented by tags or group of tags.

### 3. Whether you are going or not

As stated in the previous section, attending an event and checking into a venue will make you "like" something more. And that's the really important part.

How will we get people to really go to this places and events? Besides them being interested in just going somewhere, I believe that strategic partnerships with venues, event promoters and organizers, and a very simple check-in system will allow us to provide benefits to the users and perhaps make some early bucks.

## Roadmap to v1.0

Ah, this are great, roadmaps. They tell you where you'll be and how much progress you'll have and –oh wait, those are timelines. And we don't have one, but we do have an order in which we are going to hit some features, regardless of time, and this is it:

> Note: the title number is the version number achieved after the explained features are implemented.
